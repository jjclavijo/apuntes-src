* Binomial series
                                                                                                                     
The *binomial series* is the Maclaurin series for the function
$f$
given by
$f(x) = (1 + x)^{\alpha}$
where
$\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$
is an arbitrary complex number. Explicitly,

$$\begin{matrix}
{(1 + x)^{\alpha}} & {= \sum\limits_{k = 0}^{\infty}\;{(\frac{\alpha}{k})}\; x^{k}\qquad\qquad\qquad(1)} \\
 & {= 1 + \alpha x + \frac{\alpha(\alpha - 1)}{2!}x^{2} + \cdots,} \\
\end{matrix}$$

and the binomial series is the power series on
the right hand side of (1), expressed in terms of the
(generalized) binomial coefficients

$${(\frac{\alpha}{k})}:=\frac{\alpha(\alpha - 1)(\alpha - 2)\cdots(\alpha - k + 1)}{k!}$$

** Special cases

If $\alpha$ is a nonnegative integer $n$, then the $(n + 2)^{th}$ term and all
later terms in the series are 0, since each contains a factor
$n-n$; thus in this case the series is finite and gives the
algebraic binomial formula.

The following variant holds for arbitrary complex $\beta$, but is especially
useful for handling negative integer exponents in (1):

$$\frac{1}{(1 - z)^{\beta + 1}} = \sum\limits_{k = 0}^{\infty}{(\frac{k + \beta}{k})}z^{k}.$$

To prove it, substitute $x=-z$ in (1) and apply a binomial
coefficient identity, which is,

$${(\frac{- \beta - 1}{k})} = ( - 1)^{k}{(\frac{k + \beta}{k})}.$$

** Summation of the binomial series

The usual argument to compute the sum of the binomial series goes as
follows. Differentiating term-wise the binomial series within the
convergence disk $|x| < 1$ and using formula (1), one has that the sum
of the series is an analytic function
solving the ordinary differential equation $(1+x)u'(x) = \alpha u(x)$
with initial data $u(0) = 1$. The unique solution of this
problem is the function $u(x) = (1+x)^{\alpha}$, which is therefore
the sum of the binomial series, at least for $|x|<1$. The equality
extends to $|x|=1$ whenever the series converges, as a consequence of
Abel's theorem and by continuity of $(1+x)^{\alpha}$.
